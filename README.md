# Design Rationale:<br/>
## Design Inspiration and Design Planning
I created this portfolio to show off my projects using a clean, professional website. I used a dark green aesthetic across the platform for consistency and to grab the users' attention as it diverges from the usual white backdrop of most websites and portfolios. I felt that green would be a good color to use as it is often used as backdrops. 
<br/>
I also looked at other portfolios (as seen in the inspiration boards in the documents folder) to find what I liked/disliked when it came to showing off who I am, not only as an artist but also as a professional. I then created different level wireframes which slowly incorporated my inspirations and my needs to create a website that I am proud of. 
<br/>
## My Design Goals
With this project I had 2 main goals:
- **Easy to use:** As a student who wants to go into the UX/UI industry, ease of use was one of the most important factors in this project. I wanted the layout to be simple and allow users to access any of my projects and easily manouver around the site. To attain this goal, I created a responsive design using media queries in my styling for different screen sizes. I also tried to use buttons and links as much as possible to accomodate touch screens/ mobile users. <br/>

- **Beautiful aesthetics:** Since this is a portfolio, one of its' main goals is to show off who I am as both an artist and a professional; and how I incorporate my artistry into my professionalism. So, I developed this website to have a visually appealing yet clean atmosphere. I avoided having too much on one page and avoiding unnecessary noise. I also wanted my projects to be the focus of the site which is why the projects page has the most content. <br/>

# Technologies and tools used 
**Language/Framework:** Svelte.kit, HMTL/CSS & JavaScript. <br/>

[W3schools:](https://www.w3schools.com/) <br/>
I used several of the w3schools tutorials to help with both the styling and javascript for this project, some of the main uses of this website were alerts, helping with display/ justify-content/etc, and image styling. I also used their "How to" for my components to adapt them to the svelte framework. <br/>

[Penpot:](https://design.penpot.app/#/dashboard/files?team-id=97e3b265-5e0f-8061-8005-8f29253a4419&project-id=b0a57cee-9438-8008-8005-93261a2e54b)<br/> 
I used this to create my wireframes and initial designs/inspiration boards. 

[Svelte Dev Documents:](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/configuration#prerender)
I used this to fix prerender issues I had when I was trying to build my app.

This is where I stored my depository and deployed my pages.

Class Notes:
I also used my notes from lectures as well as notes from my Leaving Certificate Computer HTML/CSS lessons.<br/><br/>

# Personal Reflection:
**Challenges I faced:**<br/>
During this project I faced many challenges. <br/>

One of my main challenges was trying to get all my elements on my website to look/ position like they did in my wireframes. When I first started this project, I found some difficulty centering and aligning divs/elements how I had intially designed. I wanted to have a lot of my items centered but I didn't understand how inheriting different margins and displays worked but through trial and error I managed to get the pages styled how I wanted them to; but then I had to make them responsive which started the process again as I had to change the display and flex-direction which I figured out with the help of w3schools (referenced above). <br/>

Another challenge I faced was when I tried to recreate an idea I had early in the design phase. Instead of having a boring Contact page, I wanted to make it interactive and get the user to click on numbered coins in order to unlock my contact details. Initially I wanted to use a canvas to create this experience as we had used a HTML canvas in a previous module. However, I had great difficulty in utilising this attribute in the svelte framework and due to the time constraints, I decided to prioritise have a functional contact page rather than a glitchy/ visually unappealing but interactive one. <br/> 

**What I learned:** <br/> 
I really improved my Javascript and HTML through this project as well as getting familiar with the Svelte framework.<br/>
I also improved my understanding of the display attribute and how parent/child inheritance works and how to bypass/ find solutions. <br/>
I now understand responsive design and how to properly implement it.<br/>

## Deployment Issues. 
I only had one deployment issue as I had deployed a svelte project through github for a group project also done in this module (**see my pinned repositories or my websites section of my portfolio*).<br/>

The only issue I ran into was when I was building my file, I have a component which references an id that only exists on the page that it is utilised on, because of this, the svelte.kit could not find the id that is referenced in the function and initiated a build error which stopped the build before the folder could be opened. At first I didn't understand why the error was occuring so I used Visual Studio suggestion and followed to the svelte documents, where I found an attribute that ignored this warning and continued to build which I then used. 


# Reflections:
Overall I'm really happy with how this project turned out and the lessons that I learned from it.
