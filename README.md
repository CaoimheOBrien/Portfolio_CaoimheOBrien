  ## Code Credits that helped my site:
  [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
  I used several of the w3schools tutorials to help with both the styling and javascript for this project, some of the main uses of this website were alerts, helping with display/ justify-content/etc, and image styling. I also used their "How to" for my components to adapt them to the svelte framework.

#Design Rationale:
##Design Inspiration
I created this portfolio to show off my projects using a clean, professional website. I used a dark green aesthetic across the platform for consistency and to grab the users' attention as it diverges from the usual white backdrop of most websites and portfolios. I felt that green would be a good color to use as it is often used as backdrops. I also looked at other portfolios (as seen in the inspiration boards in the documents folder) to find what I liked/disliked when it came to showing off who I am, not only as an artist but also as a professional.
