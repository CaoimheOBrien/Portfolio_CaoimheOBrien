  ## Code Credits that helped my site:
  [w3schools] (https://www.w3schools.com/)
  I used several of the w3schools tutorials to help with both the styling and javascript for this project, some of the main uses of this website were alerts, helping with display/ justify-content/etc, and image styling. I also used their "How to" for my components to adapt them to the svelte framework.
